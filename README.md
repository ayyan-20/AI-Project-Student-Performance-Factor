# 🎓 AI Project: Student Pass/Fail Prediction

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on academic and personal performance factors. 
The project demonstrates the practical application of **classification algorithms** in the education domain.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Source:** Kaggle 
- **Dataset Name:** Student Performance Factors 
- **Type:** Educational Dataset 
- **Target Variable:** Pass / Fail (Binary)

A new column **Pass** was created using exam score:
- Pass = 1 → Score ≥ 70 
- Pass = 0 → Score < 70 

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression 
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification 
- **Goal:** Predict student academic outcome (Pass or Fail)

Logistic Regression is suitable because it is efficient, interpretable, and widely used for classification tasks.

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied:
- Handling missing values using mean imputation 
- Encoding categorical variables into numerical form 
- Separating features and target variable 
- Splitting data into training and testing sets 

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

### ✔ Confusion Matrix
Shows correct and incorrect predictions:
- True Positive 
- True Negative 
- False Positive 
- False Negative 

### ✔ Accuracy
Measures overall correctness of predictions.

### ✔ Precision
Measures how many predicted pass students actually passed.

### ✔ Recall
Measures how many actual pass students were correctly identified.

### ✔ F1 Score
Provides a balance between precision and recall.
